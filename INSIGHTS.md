# SQLite Analytics Challenge - Business Insights

## What I Found

### Task 1: Top Customers
- The top 5 customers spend the most money with us
- We should focus on keeping these customers happy
- I included all orders (not just delivered ones) to see total customer activity

### Task 2: Product Categories
- Some categories make way more money than others
- The top categories should get more inventory and marketing
- When I compared all orders vs delivered orders, some categories had different rankings - this means some have more cancellations

### Task 3: Employee Salaries
- Some employees earn more than the average in their department
- These are probably senior staff or top performers
- Departments with lots of above-average earners might have big pay gaps between junior and senior staff

### Task 4: Cities and Loyalty
- Some cities have way more Gold (loyal) customers than others
- Cities with lots of Gold customers are our strongest markets
- Cities with mostly Bronze and Silver customers could be new customers we can upgrade to Gold

## What The Company Should Do
- Create VIP programs for top-spending customers
- Spend more marketing money on the best-selling categories
- Check if salary differences are fair across departments
- Run loyalty campaigns in cities with lots of Silver customers to upgrade them to Gold
